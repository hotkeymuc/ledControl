LED Control

My "simple" RGB LED control software.
Compatible with Arduino UNO etc. as well as ESP8266/ESP32.
Please see the #defines in the main Arduino file to configure your system.

Effects are defined by using "Effects Layers".

You can use the python client to push raw pixel data to the device.
